Input plugins: responsible for collecting data into Logstash
Filter plugins: process and manipulate the data collected by input plugins
Output plugins: send processed data to a destination, such as Elasticsearch or a file
Codecs: define how data is serialized and deserialized in Logstash
Configuration: specify the input, filter, and output plugins to use and how they are connected
Grok patterns: regular expressions used to extract structured data from unstructured log messages
Log message parsing: process of converting unstructured log messages into structured data
Event handling: how Logstash processes each incoming log event
Data normalization: converting inconsistent data into a consistent format
Field mapping: mapping data fields to a common format
Conditionals: logic statements that allow Logstash to take different actions based on the data being processed
Plugins: add new functionality to Logstash, such as input, filter, or output plugins
Performance optimization: techniques for improving Logstash performance and scalability
Monitoring: tracking and analyzing Logstash performance and resource usage
Debugging: identifying and resolving issues with Logstash configuration and plugins
Security: ensuring the security and privacy of data processed by Logstash
Input format: specifying the format of incoming data, such as JSON or CSV
Output format: specifying the format of processed data, such as JSON or CSV
Processing pipelines: the series of input, filter, and output plugins used to process data in Logstash
Elasticsearch integration: sending processed data to Elasticsearch for indexing and analysis
Kibana integration: using Kibana for visualizing and analyzing Logstash data in Elasticsearch
Scaling: techniques for scaling Logstash to handle large amounts of data
Load balancing: distributing incoming log data across multiple Logstash instances for improved performance
Fault tolerance: ensuring Logstash continues to process data even in the event of failures or outages
Centralized logging: collecting log data from multiple sources into a central repository for analysis and storage
Data processing: transforming raw data into a format that is more useful for analysis and reporting
Data enrichment: adding additional information to log data to make it more valuable for analysis
Data transformation: changing the format or structure of log data to make it more suitable for analysis
Data indexing: making log data searchable and accessible for analysis
Data analysis: using tools such as Kibana to analyze and visualize log data
Dashboards: customizable visual representations of log data in Kibana
Visualizations: graphs, charts, and other visual representations of log data in Kibana
Alerts: notifications triggered by Logstash data matching specified conditions
Aggregation: grouping log data by common fields for analysis and reporting
Reports: pre-built or custom reports in Kibana based on log data
Search: searching log data in Elasticsearch using search queries
Queries: specify which log data to retrieve and how to retrieve it
