sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk (for Amazon Linux) or sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre (for Ubuntu)

Add the Elasticsearch repository to the source list by running the command:
sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo

Add the following contents to the elasticsearch.repo file:
[elasticsearch-7.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 7.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
