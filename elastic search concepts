Index: An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. You can think of an index as a database in a traditional relational database management system.

Document: A document is a basic unit of information in Elasticsearch. It can be a JSON object that contains fields and values.

Type: A type is a logical division within an index, used to group related documents. A type is like a table in a traditional relational database management system.

Field: A field is a unit of information within a document. It can be a single value or an array of values.

Node: A node is a single instance of Elasticsearch that is part of a cluster. A node stores data and participates in the indexing and search processes.

Cluster: A cluster is a group of one or more nodes that work together to index and search data. The cluster handles load balancing and data replication, and provides a single point of access for search and indexing operations.

Shard: A shard is a portion of an index that is stored on a single node in the cluster. Elasticsearch automatically distributes shards across nodes in a cluster for scalability and reliability.

Replica: A replica is a copy of a shard that is stored on another node in the cluster. Replicas provide increased availability and improved performance during search operations.

Query: A query is a request to search the data in Elasticsearch. Queries can be written in various formats, such as the query string, JSON, or the query DSL (Domain Specific Language).

Aggregation: An aggregation is a process of aggregating data from multiple documents and performing calculations on the aggregated data. Elasticsearch supports various types of aggregations, such as terms, histograms, and stats.

Mapping: A mapping is a way of defining the structure of a document and its fields in Elasticsearch. It defines the data types of the fields, such as string, integer, and date, and can also specify additional properties such as indexing options, analyzers, and aggregations.

Analyzer: An analyzer is a combination of tokenizer and filters that is used to break a text into tokens (commonly known as terms), and perform operations such as lowercasing, stemming, and removing stop words.

Tokenizer: A tokenizer splits a text into tokens (terms) that can be processed and searched. Elasticsearch supports various tokenizers, such as the standard tokenizer, edgeNGram tokenizer, and whitespace tokenizer.

Filter: A filter modifies the tokens generated by the tokenizer. Elasticsearch provides various filters, such as lowercase filter, stop words filter, and stemming filter.

Inverted Index: An inverted index is a data structure used by Elasticsearch to store and retrieve data efficiently. It maps terms to the documents that contain those terms, allowing for fast search and retrieval of relevant documents.

Routing: Routing is the process of determining which shard a document should be indexed on. By default, Elasticsearch uses a hash of the document ID to determine the shard. Custom routing can also be defined, which can be useful for improving search performance or for handling large amounts of data.

Alias: An alias is a way of giving multiple names to an index in Elasticsearch. Aliases can be used to redirect search requests, to perform operations on multiple indices at once, or to create temporary indices.

Index Templates: An index template is a way of defining the structure of an index in Elasticsearch, including its mappings, settings, and aliases. Index templates can be used to automatically create new indices with the desired structure, and to enforce consistency across indices.

Relevance Scoring: Relevance scoring is the process of determining the relevance of a document to a search query. Elasticsearch uses a relevance score, based on the TF-IDF algorithm, to determine the relevance of a document to a query.

Query DSL: Query DSL is the Elasticsearch Domain Specific Language used to write queries. It is a JSON-based syntax for querying Elasticsearch and is used for more complex search scenarios.

Filter Context: Filter context is a type of query context that is used to filter search results based on specific conditions. Filter context is used in conjunction with query context to perform both filtering and scoring of search results.

Geo Queries: Geo queries are a type of query used to search for documents based on their geographic location. Elasticsearch supports various types of geo queries, such as Geo Bounding Box, Geo Distance, and Geo Polygon.

Nested Documents: Nested documents are a type of document that contains one or more other documents as fields. Nested documents are useful for indexing and searching complex data structures, such as arrays and objects.

Parent-Child Relationships: Parent-child relationships are a type of relationship between two types of documents in Elasticsearch. A parent document can have multiple child documents, and child documents can be searched and retrieved based on their relationship with the parent document.

Percolation: Percolation is a feature in Elasticsearch that allows you to register a query and then receive notifications when documents match that query. Percolation can be used for various purposes, such as real-time alerting, or to perform index-time operations on documents that match a certain criteria.

Distributed Search: Distributed search is a feature in Elasticsearch that allows you to search across multiple nodes in a cluster. Distributed search is used to improve the scalability and performance of search operations by distributing the search load across multiple nodes.
